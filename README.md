# DevOps with Docker

This repository contains my solutions, examples, and notes for the **[DevOps with Docker](https://devopswithdocker.com/)** course by the **University of Helsinki**.  
The course consists of three graded chapters that cover Docker fundamentals, Docker Compose, and container security and optimization.


## Certificate of Completion

Once all chapters are completed and verified, the official certificate will appear here.

**Certificate:** _Coming soon_
